hello this file explains how to run the server.

requirements:
- python
- django (https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.2/intro/install/)
- postgresql (https://www.postgresql.org/download/)
- pgadmin (https://www.pgadmin.org/download/)
- pip (https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

steps:
1. open up pgadmin and create an account. pgadmin is just a GUI tool to interact with postgresql
2. right click databases and create a new database. this will be your database name (remember it)
3. create an .env file in server/backend with the following information

DB_NAME=[your database name]
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=[your password]
DB_HOST=127.0.0.1
DB_PORT=5432
DEBUG=on
SECRET_KEY=[there is a secret key i have shared it in the discord]

note about the key: i'm not really sure how the key works still. django created it, and my guess is that
it's used as some sort of hashing mechanism for the object relational mapper, not sure though.

4. in terminal cd to server
5. run py manage.py runserver
